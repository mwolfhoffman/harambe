I was messing around with an HTML/JS canvas tutorial and came up with this very simple game.

Currently it only works on desktop. 

I wanted to learn more about moving objects across the screen. 

This game takes Harambe, who is a hero, and tries to rescue children that fall in his gorilla pit. 

May Harambe live on in our hearts.
